simulaLEV
=========

simulator for our lights and laser shows at www.playmodes.com

basically it's a small app that allows u to get a 3D model in FBX from Cinema4D and walk through it.
we use it as a simulator as setting up a complex laser and light show it's very expensive or impossible before hand. So we use the simulator to recreate the space and make the audiovisual composition on the studio.

from the FBX i get the geometry and 8 lights (still static) and null objectes named "laser_X" to be able to draw the laser rays in OF.
